#### Mark's comment
This took 3 hours 2 mins and did not require any deep thinking - just looking up how to do something (eg. expanding the bottom stack widget) on Google, then implementing it.  Fit and finish took some time, but always does.

One tricky part here was getting the background image to repeat all the way to the bottom.  A useful hack was to use a non-transparent image first (sunshine.jpg) to ensure that it was working correctly (it turns out Positioned widget is perfect).

Next time I suggest giving a shorter layout assignment, or even give an algorithm challenge instead since that is where the students were failing morning challenge.
