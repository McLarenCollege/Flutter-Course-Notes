#### Mark's comment
This took 3 hours and did not require any deep thinking - just looking up how to do something (eg. expanding the bottom stack widget) on Google, then implementing it.  Fit and finish took some time, but always does.

Next time I suggest giving a shorter layout assignment, or even give an algorithm challenge instead since that is where the students were failing morning challenge.
