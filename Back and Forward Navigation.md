# Back and Forward Navigation

Fork the [navigation-js](https://github.com/McLarenCollege/navigation-js) react project and fork it as a private repository.  

Then implement Back and Forward in a similar manner to browser back and forward buttons.  

- Only modify Model.js
- Do not write any react code - this should be completed only using plain Javascript
- Commit and push the code to github
- Add McLarenCollege as a collaborator to your repository
- Submit on Airtable form
