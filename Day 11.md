    - Refactor code to remove repeating of logic (Think of widgets and methods)

4. **Stretch**  Kismet App Improvements
    - As of now we are using if/else blocks to navigate the stories. Imagine having longer stories, it would mean more if/else block.
    Basically not a scalable way of creating app.
    - Use the [JSON data](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/McLarenCollege/45f2c0107d9436b2f64a588cbd243a6a/raw/09fb409998a24a5dfdf0f7b378e58284c9e3423e/kismet_story.json) to modify the `story` class 
    - Refactor storyBrain 
    
5. **Stretch** Quotes Application
    - Build Quotes app from Scratch
    - The starter repo contains bare minimum layout and a json file
    - Figure out how to read json file without using external package
    - Create quote class (You decide the fields)
    - Use the class to convert json to list of quotes
    - design the layout and use the list of quotes to display them
