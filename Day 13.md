3. Kismet App Improvements (if not done yesterday)
    - As of now we are using if/else blocks to navigate the stories. Imagine having longer stories, it would mean more if/else block.
    Basically not a scalable way of creating app.
    - Use the [JSON data](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/McLarenCollege/45f2c0107d9436b2f64a588cbd243a6a/raw/09fb409998a24a5dfdf0f7b378e58284c9e3423e/kismet_story.json) to modify the `story` class 
    - Refactor storyBrain 
    
4. Quotes Application (if not done yesterday)
    - Build Quotes app from Scratch [Starter Repository](https://github.com/McLarenCollege/quotes_app_starter)
    - The starter repo contains bare minimum layout
    - Make a network request to `https://favqs.com/api/qotd`
