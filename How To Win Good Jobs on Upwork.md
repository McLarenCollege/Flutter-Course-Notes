# How to Win Good Jobs on Upwork

This is a document to review the jobs you select to apply to on Upwork, and the checklist you must follow while writing your proposals and applying for the same.


### Step 1: Create a good Upwork profile

Once you've read throught [this](https://github.com/McLarenCollege/Flutter-Course-Teacher-Notes/blob/master/Settingup_upwork(overview).md) article and finished setting up your profile, use the below checklists to make Upwork successful for you!

### Step 2: Identify good jobs to apply for

Treat Upwork like a constant stream of jobs, meaning jobs are being posted constantly on the platform, and you should be checking Upwork as regularly as possible to be able to bid for good jobs. Look at upwork, twice a day if not every day. You should be looking at all jobs under the filter of your skills. Doing this will sharpen your skills to filter jobs much quicker and get a wider understanding of the types of jobs being posted everyday.

Use this initial filter to skip jobs if 2 of these criteria are not met:
* Payment Verified
* Western Client
* Experience level not Expert 

In the table below, use the point system to figure out which jobs are worth investing time in to create a proposal and sample app. The total score is 100, try and get a job that score more than 60 overall. Jobs that score more than 85 should be applied for ASAP without wasting any time.

| Job Details | Criteria | Points |
| :----------- | :---------- | :---------- |
| The job posting location | Western or European (rich) country | 10 |
| Time of job posting | Less than 12 hrs (10 pts) or Less than 24 hours (5 pts) | 10 or 5 |
| Hire Rate | More than 50% | 10 |
| Money Spent & Average Hourly Rate | Money spent more than 1k USD (5 pts) and avg hourly rate more than 8 USD (5 pts) | 5 + 5 |
| Reviews & overall rating | Rating should be more than 4 stars | 10 |
| Payment Verified | If yes | 5 |
| Payment for the job | Hourly rate or fixed rate, FAIR ENOUGH to match the work | 10 |
| Proposals + Invites | Less than 10 (10 pts) or Less than 20 (5 pts) | 10 or 5 |
| Room to showcase skills | Create Sample App | 10 |
| Preferred Qualifications | Matching all your qualifications (10 pts) or Partially (5 pts) | 10 or 5 |
| Actively interviewing | Less than 5 | 5 |
| **Total Score** | | **100** |

While keeping the above criteria's in mind, it is also good to understand the availabilty of jobs in total on Upwork. If there are a lot of job postings under the filters of Flutter and React, then choose your jobs that score high as per the point system above or your liking, but if the jobs available are not that many then you better pick the best job and create a great proposal to get hired for that job.

### Step 3: Submit a great proposal
So what do great upwork proposals look like? Use the point system below to rate your proposals, we filter proposals that score more than 70 as a good proposal.

| Proposal Details | Points |
| :----------- | :---------- |
| Address and acknowledge each requirement mentioned in the job description | 20 |
| Ask questions in your proposal | 10 |
| Include a sample app and video | 10 + 10 |
| Focus on helping the client, offer a suggestion or feedback | 10 |
| Set expectations on timeframe and deliverables | 10 |
| Show interest in the project or job overall | 10 |
| Write enthusiastically | 10 |
| Format your proposal well, with enough line spacing and paraphrashing | 10 |
| Starting your proposal with your name or occupation | -20 |
| **Total Score** | **100** |

1. **Address each requirement and technology listed by the client**. If the job posting has specifically listed out requirements or mentioned it somewhere in the job description, it is important that you address each of them to better your chances and make the client feel like you have actually read the entire listing and are truely interested. Example, if they mention we would like to stay in touch everyday with our remote team or ask about a specific technology, then you must address those requirements, you can say you are comfortable working with remote teams via Slack or Zoom, or address the technology requirement directly by stating your experience with that skill.
2. **Ask questions about the requirements** - Doing this shows that you are really intrested and ready to start the project as soon as possible. Ask any form of question, about the project itself, about the future roadmap, about the technologies used, the team, etc.eg. how often will the spreadsheet be updated?  Will they be happy to release a new version of the app each time they want to update the spreadsheet, or do they want to put a CSV file on a server somewhere and load it into the app on startup?.
3. **Include a sample app with a video** (with good audio and video quality). Use an already excisting template to create something the client is looking for, this way you save time, trying to figure out the design and capabilities of the demo app. When making the video for the sample app, show your face in the recorded video, have clear sudio and showcase your communication skills.
4. **Focus on helping the client — not just getting the job**. Offer a suggestion or your ideas on how to make the work or product better, if there is no room for suggestions, offer a feedback or your thoughts on the project and what the client is aiming to achieve through the project.
5. **Setting expectations on timeframe and deliverables**, If the scope of work is pretty clear, you can mention how long you would take to deliver the project or if the scope is not clear, you can still ask for more details and give a extimated timeline of delivery. You can also list out the deliverables you can offer if per the scope of work mentioned in the job posting.
6. **Show interest or write like you’re talking to a real person** Start to build your relationship with the first conversation, avoid sounding robotic, have a conversation tone, greet them, mention something impressive about the project if the details are available. Basically if you cover point 2 and 4 in your proposal, you are half way through sounding like you are talking to a real person.
7. **Write enthusiastically** - Write like you are interested in the technology and business model. Mention you are excited to work on the project becasue of (specifically mention what it is that excites you in the project). You want this specific job and are not just sending out proposals to beat the odds.
8. **Make sure to format the proposal text well**, Make your proposal look nice, with enough line spaces and sections. It shouldn't be a set of indivisual statements, paraphrase the proposal well, like you are writing an email or letter.
9. **Do not start your proposal with** your name and what you do, the first two lines of any proposal are very important and should be written smartly to get the client to click on your proposal.

**Tip: use [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/?q=brand&utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=brand_f1&utm_content=&utm_term=grammarly&matchtype=e&placement=&network=s&msclkid=ef3ffb41562e13a87782a47f6187b688) to compose mistake-free writing of proposals.**

> Hello there,
>
> I would be happy to start work on this project immediately.  I think it will be fun and challenging to make an app to open large PDF files without any performance issues.
> 
> I am a full-stack developer based in India. I have been programming in Flutter for the last 10 months and enjoy using it to build Android and iOS apps. I don't mind working in > a different timezone and collaborating with remote teams, as per your requirement.
> 
> Having never worked with AWS Cognito before, I went ahead and created a small application to understand it better, you can sign up with email and it sends an OTP to verify > > > your email address. I was able to do it in a short span of time because I have a lot of experience with Firebase. You can also browse through my past work in my Upwork profile > or on my Github link, here.
> 
> I am also very good at communication and liked the idea of doing daily calls so there is no misunderstanding. In fact, I have been using Slack and Zoom daily (except weekends) > for my other contracts and projects I was part of. Send me a quick message and we can figure out if we are a good fit to work together!
> 
> 1. How many years of mobile development do you have? which platforms? what kind of applications?
> I have been fascinated with mobile apps for a long time and have been creating custom mods long before I started programming. I have 10 months of Flutter experience. I have > > created different types of apps like:
> - News Reader App (mclarentimes.com) which used Firebase Database and cloud functions for scraping news and Flutter on the frontend.
> - Spotify Clone - Used Spotify API to make a music player app
> - Full-stack CRM application - Backend was written in NodeJS and ExpressJS which used MongoDB as database and wrote a Flutter client
> 
> 2. What is your experience with Flutter? Any relevant open source contributions that you can share?
> I enjoyed programming in Flutter because of the hot reload feature which means there is no waiting time to see code in action. I haven't made any open source contributions but > most of the apps I have written personally like TicTacToe game, BMI App, etc. are available on my GitHub profile.
> 
> 3. What past project or job have you had that is most like this one and why?
> I have not worked with AWS Cognito but I did work with creating Authentication in Flutter using Firebase and session cookies. To be confident that I can take this project I > > looked at AWS Cognito and implemented a sample app. I have created a CRM app in which you can add/delete customers. The delete feature didn't actually delete the customer but > updated the status of the delete flag in the database. I wrote the API for that app as well.
> 
> 4. What questions do you have about the project?
> I am confident that I can implement any UI in Flutter and would like to see the screens if they are ready. 
> I have a question about one of the requirements which mentions "Search for a report", will we be implementing search which looks at the content of the report as well?

Writing cover letters can be taxing and time-consuming, so make things easier for yourself by creating a template. You can personalize this template for each job you apply to, so you don't have to start from scratch for each cover letter.

### Step 4: Good Upwork ethics & practises
"All of your talent is wasted without good attitude and work ethic."

* Try and start with a video call or phone call to build trust and credibility
* Understand the job, take a briefing from the client and set milestones for each deliverable. Ask if there are any specific ways to treat the work or any deadlines you will be working with. Never overpromise. Instead, set realistic expectations of your work and be transparent about turnaround time and revisions. 
* Make sure to start off any job with the Upwork contract
* Use the [Upwork Diary](https://support.upwork.com/hc/en-us/articles/211068518-Use-Your-Work-Diary) to keep a log of the hours invested in the job
* Leep clients updated on the status of their projects, alert them to any changes as soon as possible and get back to any questions within one business day.
* Ask for feedback after each revision to make sure you're on the same page as your client. 
* Be responsive and keep track of deadlines
* Ask for feedback and a good review once your contract is over and the job has been delivered successfully.
