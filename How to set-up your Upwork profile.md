Your Upwork profile is critical for landing jobs as a freelancer. Clients use it to decide who to interview, and they also invite freelancers to interview directly after finding them in search results. So if you create an Upwork profile that gets seen and clicked in search results, you’ll start getting interviews without having to even send out proposals!

**We hope you've already read [this checklist](./job_ready_checklist.md) to have a great profile in general for any job serach or freelancer platform!**

Completing your profile doesn’t just give clients the info they need, it also helps Upwork match you with more relevant projects. It's also required if you want to achieve Rising Talent or Top Rated status. But what does a top-notch profile look like?

### Step 1: Setting up your Upwork profile

1. A good picture. Clients want to feel they can trust a freelancer before they engage them for a project and your profile photo is an important part of the equation. 
2. Showcase your skills, add all the tags to your profile that corresspond to your skill set and offerings.
3. Highlight your expertise, add a powerful and honest title. Why is it so important? Because when a client finds your profile in search, your title is the first thing they’ll see.
4. Feature your best work, if your skills aren’t particularly visual, try to find creative ways to explain the challenge behind each sample and how your work had an impact.
5. Listing the certifications you’ve earned can help prove your specific knowledge or abilities, particularly if they relate to specific systems or software your clients may look for.
6. Add your employment history, adding relevant details about your employment history can help clients understand your background, both on and off Upwork.
7. Include your education and other experiences. Your knowledge doesn’t just stem from your previous work experience! Your education and other activities — such as volunteer positions, mentorship programs, online courses, and other extracurricular activities — can also help shape what you do and how you present yourself online.
8. Update your profile visibility if your profile has been switched to “private” due to inactivity
9. Link other professional accounts in your profile settings to help Upwork match you better to jobs
10. Build on your reviews and referrrals from clients. You can even add pass employment referrals to your Upwork profile.
