- Remain patient and calm during the session
- Keep an open mind towards problem solving and receiving feedback from your mentees

### Discussing Algorithm
- Make sure students understand the problem 
    - Ask them to describe the problem by taking an example
    - Ask(or help) them in drawing a diagram
- Do not give away the solution of the problem (Ever)
- Describe the best algorithm that you have used to solve the problem
    - use diagram
- Check if mentees have understood the algorithm
    - Ask one of them to describe the algorithm by taking an example
- If the algorithm is too complex try writing pseudo-code

### Solving Doubt
Students can ask you doubts from ongoing topic if there is time.
- If it is a bug, you can ask them which steps they have followed from [this document](https://github.com/McLarenCollege/Flutter-Course-Notes/blob/master/Misc.md)
- You can ask other mentees if anyone would like to help them
- If you've given a solution or described a way to solve, and the session did not have time left to see the results from the student, ask for the results in the next session.
