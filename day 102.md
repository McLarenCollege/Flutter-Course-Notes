# Morning Challenge

## Animal Game Chatbot
- We have written a [console game](https://github.com/McLarenCollege/animal_guess_game_starter) which plays the "animal game" where the bot guesses the animal that user is thinking of
- We also have written a chatbot which can communicate with the user based on predefined questions
- Now in today's morning challenge we want to integrate the two.
