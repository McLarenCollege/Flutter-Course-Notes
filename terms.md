# McLaren College App Development Course - A Guide For Prospective Students
Our 9-month app development course is comprised of a 3-month tuition period followed by 6-
month paid training period.  

### General Rules
- We expect you to be present online from 8.30 AM to 5.30 PM IST Monday to Friday
- We will declare holiday breaks in advance after consultation with all students  
- You may take 1 day's leave per month with 24 hours notice
- If you are absent you will have to spend extra time outside of class hours to make up for missed coursework
- You must have a good internet connect and fast computer with good audio and video capability 
- We will conduct a phone interview with your parents to ensure they agree with these terms and fee structure
- We may drop you from the course at any time if we find your attendance or work unsatisfactory, or if your behaviour is unprofessional


### Training Stipend ###
- During the 6-month training period we will pay you a monthly stipend of INR 35,000


### Course Fees ###
- After completing this course, you must pay us a percentage of your pre-tax income for a total of 48 months.
- This percentage is 10% if your monthly income is above INR 50,000, or 15% if it is above INR 1 lac.  
- For periods where your monthly income is less than INR 50,000 you will not have to pay us any course fees.  However, such 
periods will not count towards the 48-month requirement above.  For example, if you have no income for 3 months after 
completing our course and are then hired as a software developer, you must pay us a percentage of your income for 48 months 
*starting from the date you were hired*.
- At the end of course we may offer you software development position working for us full-time  
- You will not need to pay us course fees while you work full-time for us.  Each year you work for us will reduce 
the 48-month requirement by 4 months. For example, if you work for us for 4 years then join a different company you 
must pay us a percentage of your income at that company for 32 months.    


### Mentorship Requirement ###
- After you complete the course, you must agree to spend 2 hours per week acting as a mentor and tutor for following students who are participating in our software development courses
- You must do this each week until you have completely paid your tuition fee as described above, even during periods when your income is less than INR 50,000 or when you are working for us full-time


### Scenario 1
Suppose you complete the 9-month course and you accept a full-time job with McLaren College as Junior Developer earning INR 60,000 per month.  During 
your period of employment with us you do not pay any fees to the school.  After 1 year you find a better job opportunity 
earning INR 85,000 and so you decide to leave McLaren College employment.  The payback period will begin and 
you will start paying 10% of 85,000 which is INR 8,500 per month to us.  In the second year of your payback period your 
salary is increased to INR 95,000 per month, so you will be paying INR 9,500 per month in fees to us.  In the 3rd and 4th 
year of the payback period your salary is INR 1,20,000 per month, so you will be paying us 15% which is 18,000 per month.

Also in this scenario for 5 years you will spend 2 hours per week in addition to your 
normal working hours to act as a mentor and tutor to other McLaren College students.


### Scenario 2
Suppose you complete the 9-month course and you then work as a part-time freelance programmer earning INR 40,000 per 
month for 6 months.  During this time you will not need to pay us any course fee.  Let's say you then get a developer 
position paying INR 65,000 per month for 2 years - during this time you will need to pay us 6,500 per month.  Then you take off 1 year from work to 
care for your newborn baby - during this time you will not need to pay us any course fees.  When you return to work your income is INR 75,000 for 2 years, 
so you must pay us INR 7,500 per month for the full 2 years.


Also in this scenario for 5.5 years you will spend 2 hours per week to act as a mentor and tutor to other McLaren College students.
